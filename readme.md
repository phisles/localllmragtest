This project is an experimental sandbox for testing out ideas related to running local Large Language Models (LLMs) with [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for answering questions based on sample PDFs. In this project, we are also using Ollama to create embeddings with the [nomic-embed-text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text) to use with [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/). Please note that the embeddings are reloaded each time the application runs, which is not efficient and is only done here for testing purposes.

## Requirements

- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) verson 0.1.26 or higher.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a Python virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv .venv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment by running `source .venv/bin/activate` on Unix or MacOS, or `.\.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows.
4. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the Project

**Note:** The first time you run the project, it will download the necessary models from Ollama for the LLM and embeddings. This is a one-time setup process and may take some time depending on your internet connection.

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the main script with `python app.py -m <model_name> -p <path_to_documents>` to specify a model and the path to documents. If no model is specified, it defaults to [mistral](https://ollama.com/library/mistral). If no path is specified, it defaults to `Research` located in the repository for example purposes.
3. Optionally, you can specify the embedding model to use with `-e <embedding_model_name>`. If not specified, it defaults to [nomic-embed-text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text).

This will load the PDFs and Markdown files, generate embeddings, query the collection, and answer the question defined in `app.py`.

## Technologies Used

- [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain/langchain): A Python library for working with Large Language Model
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/): A platform for running Large Language models locally.
- [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/): A vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
- [PyPDF](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/): A Python library for reading and manipulating PDF files.
