Video then shows the suspect rush the homeowner before being pushed back out of the doorway. The suspect can be seen in the video holding a gun. After that, he runs off to a nearby vehicle that quickly speeds away. About an hour after the attempted robbery and home invasion, the East Haven Police Department posted pictures of the suspect on its Facebook page, asking for the public's help identifying him. Investigators say a series of tips led them to 37-year-old Xavier Arturo, the man they say is seen on the video. Officials also identified the getaway driver as 26-year-old Jean Carasquillo Torres. Investigators say the pair hacked a plan for a home invasion, where they would use zip ties to restrain the people inside the home while robbing them. Officials say the pair planned a second home invasion about an hour north in the city of Manchester.
